# Tank Level Dynamics

## Overview
This project focuses on dynamic modeling of a liquid tank system using Python. The goal is to translate physical mass balances into differential equations and solve them numerically.

## Objectives
- Develop a dynamic model for tank level behavior
- Solve the governing differential equation using Python
- Visualize system response over time

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
